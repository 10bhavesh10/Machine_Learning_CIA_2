## Coffee Recommendation System


A recommendation system is created using a web scrapped coffee recommendation website data.
A black box machine learning recommendation system model was created and dumped into a pickle file.

Using flask, the front end for the model is developed.

The first webpage asks for the login credentials and stores the saved username and password in mysql database. Mysql is used as back end to verify the login credentials.
The second webpage asks the user to input the flavours and number of recommendation require.
The third webpage displays the recommendations

Note:

The pickle is not uploaded since the file size is 400 mb.

Run app.py and the webpage runs in localhost port:3300
